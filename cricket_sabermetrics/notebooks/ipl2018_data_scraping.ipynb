cb-com-ln\">That's a wrap to today's IPL coverage. After a nail-biting finish in the tournament opener, we've had three rather dull games in a row. Tonight's one being the most one-sided of them all. Let's hope that changes soon and it could, tomorrow itself. A big game as the Chennai Super Kings gear themselves up to host the Kolkata Knight Riders at Chepauk. It's the first home game for Dhoni's men in 3 years and therefore, expect a crackling atmosphere. We'll be up nice and early for the coverage. Do join us for all the entertainment. Till then, this is <b>Hariprasad</b> signing off on behalf of my mates <b>Pradeep</b>, <b>Rishi</b>, <b>Pratyush</b>, <b>Sriram</b> and our scorer <b>Siva</b>. Cya! </p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\">A few number crunches from <b>Deepu Narayanan</b> to wrap up today's proceedings:<br/><br/><b>Wins with most balls to spare for SRH</b>:<br/>37 v DD, HYD, 2013 (Target: 81)<br/>31 v GL, Rajkot, 2016 (Target: 136)<br/>27 v GL, HYD, 2017 (Target: 136)<br/>26 v RR, HYD, 2018 (Target: 126)<br/><br/>Today's RR innings was the 11th instance of a team not hitting a six in a completed 20-overs innings in IPL. It was the fourth such instance by RR - the most for a team<br/><br/><b>Most matches in IPL</b>:<br/>162 S Raina<br/>160 R Sharma/ MS Dhoni<br/>153 D Karthik<br/>150 V Kohli/ R Uthappa/ Yusuf Pathan (today)</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Shikhar Dhawan, Man of the Match:</b> \"I enjoy playing long innings. It benefits the team, it benefits me. Trying to stretch the good form as long as possible and score big runs for as long as I can. I've been playing more aggressively since South Africa series and the Sri Lanka series, and not just in this IPL. So I'm just continuing with that formula, and I'm happy with it. We have a very balanced team, which is the strength of our side, and that is the key. We have started the tournament on a good note, and hopefully that'll help us and give us the momentum for the rest of the tournament.\"</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Kane Williamson:</b> \"No doubt we missed Davey (Warner). He's been a fantastic player for a lot of years. Good to see everyone stepping up. Guys were great on the field and all did their roles well. It was nice to see people step up well with both bat and ball. All the bowlers certainly played their part. We got wickets at key times, but it was important we fielded well. We took some really good catches. A team effort. Yes, there are small areas we can still improve. (On bowling a lot of short balls) It wasn't a planned thing, the surface was such that the short ball was coming on nicely. There was something for the pacers and the spinners while the batsmen were also to score runs. A fair surface actually. (On Dhawan's innings) I had the best seat in the house, he hit it really well. The intent was great from ball one. Saha also showed intent from the start. Hopefully we can keep it up in the coming games as well.\"</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Siddarth Kaul</b>: \"It's a pretty good feeling to win the game. I was working hard in the domestic season and in the nets as well. Glad, it came good today. Hitting the right areas was the plan for me. It was a small total but we had great experience in the batting and they played well (Shikhar and Williamson). We are missing him (David Warner), but the players are coping up with the loss and they know what to do exactly. I am looking forward to the next game.\"</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Ajinkya Rahane:</b> \"We thought 126 was on the lower side. When we were batting we thought 160 would be a great total. We did quite well as a bowling unit, but the Sunrisers were excellent with the ball. Sanju (Samson) and I tried to back our game but lost too many wickets in the middle, and that's where we lost the game. I think the lack of one big partnership is what cost us. Even one partnership would have given us a more competitive total. I'm very unhappy with the dropped catch. I work very hard on my fielding during practice, but it's a part and parcel of the game - you have some bad days. It's the first game, and we have to learn from our mistakes and not repeat them in future.\"</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>23:06 Local Time:</b> A very one-sided contest in the end. 125 was never going to be enough anyway but the way Dhawan played, made it a mockery. He was dropped on 0 though by the usually safe Rahane and the Royals will regret it badly. Not that the visitors would have won if that was taken but certainly, might have stretched the game close perhaps. As things panned out, Dhawan continued on his merry ways to smash an unbeaten half-century, keeping up with his fab form that's started since last June. The win though, was set up by SRH's bowlers who were exceptional on a track that was two-paced. The RR batsmen also didn't help their cause by not reading the surface well. A total of around 145-150 would have been more than handy on this pitch but wickets at regular intervals hurt them bad.</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">15.5</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Kulkarni to Dhawan, <b>FOUR</b>, <b>crunchy blow to end the game!</b> Shortish and sits up nicely for Dhawan who rocks back to slam the pull over mid-wicket. Blazed away to the fence and with that, <b>the Sunrisers have stormed to a win in their season opener</b></p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">15.4</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Kulkarni to Dhawan, no run, another dot! Dhawan was moving around in the crease and then gets across the stumps, Kulkarni though just keeps his calm to bowl a pinpoint wide yorker. Just bordering on the tramline but that's fine</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">15.3</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Kulkarni to Dhawan, no run, back of a length around off, Dhawan flat-bats it hard but straight to mid-off. Ah, this is taking a bit longer</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">15.2</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Kulkarni to Dhawan, no run, good slower ball, shortish in length and Dhawan was well early into the shot before deciding to let it pass</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">15.1</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Kulkarni to Dhawan, no run, short of a length and very wide outside off, Dhawan tries to reach it with a flashy cut but misses</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Dhawal Kulkarni [2.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack</b></p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\">Just a blow away are SRH. Who is going to do that is the question</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">14.6</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Arcy Short to Williamson, no run, a bit short and around off, Williamson stays back and crunches it towards cover, cannot pick the gap and seems a bit frustrated with himself</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">14.5</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Arcy Short to Williamson, no run, floated up around leg, Williamson gets across a bit and paddles it to short fine leg</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">14.4</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Arcy Short to Dhawan, 1 run, another skiddy half-tracker around off, Dhawan cuts it hard towards point where the fielder cannot make a clean stop</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">14.3</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Arcy Short to Dhawan, no run, flatter and shorter around off, Dhawan chops the cut towards point</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\">Right then, Dhawan has got the strike back</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">14.2</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Arcy Short to Williamson, 1 run, floated up outside leg, very full and Williamson flicks it away to deep mid-wicket</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">14.1</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">D Arcy Short to Dhawan, 1 run, tossed up nicely around off, Dhawan was looking for that booming shot to end the game. Ends up mistiming it down the ground to long-on</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><i>\"18,866 is the crowd count,\"</i> pings <b>Kritika</b>, who's been counting this whole time! :O</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">13.6</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">Unadkat to Dhawan, 1 run, good work at short fine leg, the fielder gets across to his right and makes a tumbling stop to save a certain boundary. This was angling in on off, Dhawan gets across with a nice shuffle and clips it with a neat deflection off his pads</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">13.5</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run, a cutter that's slightly shorter in length, Williamson makes a bit of room and whacks it to sweeper cover</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">13.4</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">Unadkat to Williamson, 2 runs, shortish and a bit of width outside off, Williamson stands tall and slaps it away. Gets it well to the right of sweeper cover who does well to stop it with a run-and-slide</p><span class=\"cb-col cb-col-8 text-bold\">13.3</span><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln\">Unadkat to Williamson, no run, cracking shot but couldn't pick the gap.

Everyone chipped in, a run-out started the rot, Rahane and Samson added 46 for the second wicket, but they didn't do so at any great rate. The captain fell trying to up the ante, Stokes failed as well. Samson started running out of partners and started losing momentum as well, there was no finishing by Buttler and in the end, 125 looks at least 20-25 short on this surface. Sunrisers had everything today, the guile of Bhuvneshwar, the pace of Stanlake, the support from Kaul and the spin from Shakib and Rashid. They will back themselves to chase this target down. Back in a while..</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Billy Stanlake, the fire-spitter:</b> \"A little nervous. Been 6 weeks since the last competitive game, so great to get back out there. The coaching staff did a great job. Lots of training sessions and practice matches. The coaching was good with the preparations and the boys are ready to go. A sticky wicket, isn't coming through as well, but I think the boys have done well.

There's loads to look forward to.</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\">The Sunrisers Hyderabad are taking on - <i>**drumroooooolllll**</i> - the <b>Rajasthan Royals</b> today. The Royals, etched metaphorically in IPL history and quite literally on the trophy, as the side to win the inaugural edition of the IPL. From the high of IPL glory, they have seen the troughs of unspeakable transgressions. But here they stand, after a brief lacuna in their legacy, ready to compete for the title once again. They've lost Steven Smith as well (the ball-tampering saga, in case you were in a coma), meaning Ajinkya Rahane has been rushed in to take over the captaincy. They have the foreign firepower of Ben Stokes, and the local talent of Tripathi in the ranks, which makes them a formidable side in this competition.<br/></p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\">Here we are at Hyderabad, awaiting Match 4 of this edition of the IPL, by the end of which each of the teams involved would've had one outing each. And the only remaining teams happen to be the ones rocked by cricket's most recent plague - ball-tampering. </p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>18:21 Local Time:</b> Wow! Has it just been two days? KL Rahul's frenetic 14-ball 50, Narine's ever-so-enigmatic caning of the leather ball, Bravo's timely surge in the opener, and Mujeeb's dose of trickery and deceit. All squeezed into just two days of the 11th edition. The IPL has well and truly arrived... and how. It's like binge-watching the Netflix dystopian neo-noir series Black Mirror; don't do it. There's only so much your brain can take. Nevertheless, such is the nature of human beings; here we are, watching games that are likely to induce cardiac arrest on a daily basis.</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\">*****</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b> Preview by Kritika Naidu </b><br/><br/>Kane Williamson made a statement on the eve of Sunrisers Hyderabad's opening game of the Indian Premier League. The skipper of the Hyderabad-based franchise was the only batsman in the nets an hour prior to the arrival of the rest of the team for their final practice session ahead of the season opener against the Rajasthan Royals.<br/><br/>Being given throw-downs by assistant coach Simon Helmot for over an hour, the skipper continued to bat through until his team arrived and well beyond, working on his drives and follow-through from time to time. Knowing Williamson, it wasn't a conscious ploy to make a statement, but an effort to prepare and get himself match-ready for Sunrisers' big day on Monday (April 9).<br/><br/>Hyderabad had been hit by a hailstorm and heavy showers that had brought the city to a standstill for two hours on Saturday - two days prior to their first Indian Premier League match of the 2018 edition. With showers forecast, much in contrast to the typical heat in the month of April, the threat of wet weather looms large in the city causing concerns among some of the Hyderabad Cricket Association officials. It was, after all, only in October last year that rain and a wet outfield had washed out the Twenty20 International between India and Australia.<br/><br/>With weather being among the many uncontrollables, SRH have been meticulous about their preparation coming into the tournament. They were dealt with a mighty blow coming in with David Warner's exclusion from this season owing to the ball-tampering scandal, but they have taken it in their stride, and well. With a couple of practice games at the venue, they have had impressive performances from their local youngsters, which has pleased mentor VVS Laxman. It has also given the squad a chance to acclimatise to the leadership of Williamson, who will take over as full-time captain.<br/><br/>Rajasthan, too, on their comeback from a two-year hiatus, were dealt a similar deal, with Steve Smith being banned from the tournament along with Warner. He was the only player that the franchise opted to retain from their previous squad, but his exit meant Ajinkya Rahane was named skipper, and South African Heinrich Klaasen, his replacement.<br/><br/>Royals, too, are coming in with some good preparation back in Jaipur, before a full training session at the Uppal stadium on Saturday (April 7), before the skies opened up. Their squad boasts of familiar faces from the Rising Pune Supergiant side and the previous RR squad, which would assist Rahane and make his job easier without the challenge of having to take over a fresh set of players two weeks prior to the start of the tournament, much like Williamson.<br/><br/>While familiarity is a luxury for both skippers in this case, the challenge of deliverance will be just the same. Royals have a lot to prove given their absence over the last couple of years, while Sunrisers will be keen to show that losing their leader in Warner will not hamper their ability as a side.<br/><br/><b>What:</b> Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Rajasthan Royals<br/><br/><b>When:</b> April 9, 2018, Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad, 8:00 PM IST<br/><br/><b>What to expect:</b> A humid day in Hyderabad with temperature rising to 35 degrees is expected with showers forecast for the afternoon. The only challenge would be to get the outfield conditions in order for the teams to take the field, provided rain stays away leading into Monday.<br/><br/><b>Head-to-head:</b><br/><br/>Royals lead the head-to-head count 4-3 against the Sunrisers. However, SRH's record at home of 20 wins in 30 games will give them confidence, despite RR winningwon two of their four games played at the venue.<br/><br/><b>Team News:</b><br/><br/><b>Sunrisers Hyderabad:</b> Alex Hales joined the SRH squad four days prior to the first game and was first to bat at the nets on the eve of the game. He appears to be a sure- starter, in place of Warner at the top. Yusuf Pathan, too, had a long session in the nets, having even have headed to the nets before the rest of the squad, which could have him making the playing XI.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> Alex Hales, Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson (c), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Yusuf Pathan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Rashid Khan, Sandeep Sharma, Siddharth Kaul/Basil Thampi<br/><br/><b>Rajasthan Royals:</b> Klaasen was picked on the back of his impressive show against the Indian spinners in South Africa recently, which would hold him in good stead to be picked for their series opener against SRH, given the plethora of spin options that the hosts have in their armory. Jofra Archer's availability will be subject to his fitness, as he had suffered a side-strain in the recently concluded PSL.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> Ajinkya Rahane (c), Rahul Tripathi, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Heinrich Klaasen/D'Arcy Short, K Gowtham, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Jaydev Unadkat, Dhawal Kulkarni<br/><br/><b>Did you know?</b><br/><br/>- Yusuf Pathan will be playing his 150th IPL game, if he makes the playing XI.<br/><br/>- In the last three years in IPL no target in excess of 150 has been chased down in Hyderabad. The highest target chased down in this period is 147 by DD against the home side in 2016.<br/><br/>- Rahane has got out to Bhuvneshwar six times. No other bowler has dismissed him more than thrice. Four of those six dismissals were before Rahane has opened his account and on five of the six times Bhuvneshwar got his man in his first over.<br/><br/><b>What they said:</b><br/><br/>\"The ground seems to be drying very well. We've had a couple of situations leading in to today where we've had some very heavy rain but it hasn't really affected our practice. The outfield's been okay, it's drying well. Over the last couple of days the ground staff has covered the whole ground so they're very conscious of making sure that it's in tip-top condition for our first game.\" - SRH head coach Tom Moody.<br/><br/>\"They are a very good side, very balanced and playing in Hyderabad against Sunrisers is always a challenge. We are not going to take them lightly and we respect them and that's what cricket is all about: respecting your opponents and playing to your strength rather than thinking about the opponents. We just want to go out there, play our game, back our strategies and back our strengths. We respect Sunrisers and they are a quality team.\" - Ajinkya Rahane, Rajasthan Royals captain.</p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100 cb-com-ln\"><b>Teams:</b></p><p class=\"cb-col cb-col-100
